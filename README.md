# Open Source Geoprocessing Methodologies of Sentinel-2 -- Data Processing and Classification
## Overview
This repository provides scripts of basic remote sensing methodologies using Unix and Python. This repository covers workflow to perform image classification using machine learning and deep learning classifiers:

* Preprocessing: Scripts that perform cropping, stacking and resampling of Sentinel-2 images,
* Spectral indices: Unix scripts that calculate vegetation and water indices from Sentinel-2 images,
* Classification: Python scripts that perform Land Cover Classification based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning classifiers
